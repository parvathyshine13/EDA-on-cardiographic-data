# Exploratory Data Analysis on Cardiographic Dataset

## Project Overview
This project involves conducting a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the `cardiographic.csv` dataset. The primary goal is to uncover insights, identify patterns, and understand the structure of the data through statistical summaries, visualizations, and data manipulation techniques.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains cardiographic features related to fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring:

| Feature | Description                                              |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| LB      | Baseline Fetal Heart Rate (average FHR over a period)    |
| AC      | Accelerations in FHR, indicating fetal well-being        |
| FM      | Fetal Movements detected by the monitor                   |
| UC      | Uterine Contractions impacting FHR patterns               |
| DL      | Late Decelerations (potential fetal distress indicator)  |
| DS      | Short Decelerations (brief duration)                      |
| DP      | Prolonged Decelerations (long-lasting)                    |
| ASTV    | Percentage of time with abnormal Short Term Variability  |
| MSTV    | Mean value of Short Term Variability                       |
| ALTV    | Percentage of time with abnormal Long Term Variability   |
| MLTV    | Mean value of Long Term Variability                        |

## Analysis Workflow

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Loaded the dataset and inspected for missing values.
- Handled missing data via appropriate imputation or removal.
- Corrected data types to ensure consistency for numerical and categorical variables.
- Detected and treated outliers to minimize their impact on analysis.

### 2. Statistical Summary
- Calculated key statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, interquartile range) for each feature.
- Highlighted important observations from statistical summaries, such as skewness or high variance.

### 3. Data Visualization
- Used histograms and boxplots to explore distributions and identify outliers.
- Created bar and pie charts for categorical variable distributions (if any).
- Generated scatter plots and correlation heatmaps to identify relationships between variables.
- Applied advanced visualizations like pair plots and violin plots for in-depth understanding.

### 4. Pattern Recognition and Insights
- Discovered significant correlations between certain features, indicating potential physiological relationships.
- Analyzed any temporal trends or patterns (if applicable).
- Interpreted findings in the context of fetal health monitoring.

### 5. Conclusion
- Summarized key insights derived from the analysis.
- Provided recommendations on how these insights can inform further research, clinical decisions, or model building.
